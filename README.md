## Spookbot

### Setup

1. Create a bot application from the Discord developers page.

2. Install the `py-cord` module:
```bash
    $ [sudo] pip[3] install py-cord
    OR
    $ [sudo] python[3] -m pip install py-cord
```

3. Create the file `config.json` by copying `example.json` and editing with your info.

4. Run `python[3] spookbot.py`. It should print out an invite as it starts:
```bash
    $ python[3] spookbot.py
    https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?...
```

5. Invite the bot to your server, and you're set!
